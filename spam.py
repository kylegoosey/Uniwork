# This skeleton code simply classifies every input as ham
#
# Here you can see there is a parameter k that is unused, the
# point is to show you how you could set up your own. You might
# also pass in extra data via a train method (also does nothing
#Â here). Modify this code as much as you like so long as the 
# accuracy test in the cell below runs.
